upgrade.sis.isFinished.ise=当 ServletInputStream 不处于非阻塞模式时调用 isFinished() 是非法的（即必须首先调用 setReadListener()）
upgrade.sis.read.closed=InputStream 已被关闭
upgrade.sis.readListener.set=在同一个upgraded连接上调用多次setReadListener()函数是非法的
upgrade.sos.write.closed=输出流已被关闭
upgrade.sos.writeListener.null=对setWriteListener()传递null是非法的

upgradeProcessor.unexpectedState=因传入套接字状态为[{0}]而意外关闭升级连接
