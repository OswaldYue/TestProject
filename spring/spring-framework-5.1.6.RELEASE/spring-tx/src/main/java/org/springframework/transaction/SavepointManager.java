/**
 * 保存点管理
 *
 * Interface that specifies an API to programmatically manage transaction
 * savepoints in a generic fashion. Extended by TransactionStatus to
 * expose savepoint management functionality for a specific transaction.
 *
 * <p>Note that savepoints can only work within an active transaction.
 * Just use this programmatic savepoint handling for advanced needs;
 * else, a subtransaction with PROPAGATION_NESTED is preferable.
 *
 * <p>This interface is inspired by JDBC 3.0's Savepoint mechanism
 * but is independent from any specific persistence technology.
 *
 * @author Juergen Hoeller
 * @since 1.1
